genres recognized by TMDB:

const GENRE_IDs = {
  "adventure": 12,
  "fantasy": 14,
  "animation": 16,
  "drama": 18,
  "horror": 27,
  "action": 28,
  "comedy": 35,
  "history": 36,
  "western": 37,
  "thriller": 53,
  "crime": 80,
  "documentary": 99,
  "science fiction": 878,
  "mystery": 9648,
  "music": 10402,
  "romance": 10749,
  "family": 10751,
  "war": 10752,
  "tv movie": 10770
};  

Tv movie and animation probably aren't influenced too much by personality (?), so let's ignore those.
That leaves us with 17 different genres.

We could maybe ask a series of yes/no questions where we subtly ask the user to choose one of two genres? But wouldn't that be too long?

do you like surprises?
do you like trying new things?
something about careers???
your ideal partner would punch a rude guy in the face??


Do you like having your day planned, or do you just kind of like to see things spontaneously happen (?)

---

Two men are arguging with each other about a car accident. It's unclear who's responsible. In your ideal world, how would they settle this?
alt.: What's the ideal way for two men to settle their differences?
- Pistols at dawn [might suggest preference for Western genre]
- Fight each other ?????? - [action preference?]
- Talk to each other rationally
- 

A man at the movie theater steals another person's popcorn. What would you like to see that person do?
- Talk to the man and sort things out
- Punch the man, in the face [might suggest preference for action]

Do you agree with the following statement? 
"You don't fret about why things are the way that they are. They simply are, and that suffices for you."
- Yes 
- No (might suggest disinterest in Documentary or Mystery)

"The real world is too damn boring."

This whole thing feels wrong

Something about 3D/blockbuster films?

i hate war




Maybe take a different direction?
Big Five personality traits?

Notes from a few research articles found online:
https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-33722-001
- Openness to Experience: preference for genres highlighting culture, complexity, and aesthetics [?]; dislike for romance and other "conventional" genres; preference for reflective and complex music (might be true of film too?) and less likely to enjoy upbeat/"conventional" music
- Conscientousness:
    - Increased preference for "conventional, fact-oriented media (e.g. reality television, news)"
    - Increased preference for "books related to science, romance, and current events"
    - Dislike "intense, edgy media (such as [...] cult, and horror films)

- Openness: + Dark/Alternative + Aesthetic/Musical -Communal/Popular
- Conscientiousness: + Communal/Popular +Thrilling/Action -Dark/Alternative -Aesthetic/Musical

Dark/Alt.: "edgy, unconvential, and intense"
Aes/Mus: "More cultured, complex, and artistic"
Com./Pop.: "Conventional, popular, and cheerful in nature"
Thr/Act: "More active, exciting, and adventurous."

Manolika study:
- Openness: +Nonfiction +complex +action films
- Conscientiousness: +Informational +Light -Thrilling +Science +Romance -Suspense -Literary novels
- practicality -> conservative preferences?
- Agreeableness: +light +"relatively simple genres"
- Neuroticism: +"more demanding media;" light books but not light movies
- Machiavellianism: +thrilling +fiction +intensity/violence +graphic horror
- Narcissism: +light
- "It should be noted, however, that personality accounted for a relatively small proportion of the variance in both movie and reading preferences."
- Extraversion: predicts no particular movie preference
- Study was limited; sample incldued "young adults of similar education" and relied on self-reporting

Highly relevant study:
https://www.ihu.edu.gr/tjortjis/The%2050%2050%20Recommender%20a%20Method%20Incorporating%20Personality%20into%20Movie%20Recommender%20Systems.pdf (Nalmpantis et al.)

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283270671_Relating_Personality_Types_with_User_Preferences_Multiple_Entertainment_Domains (Cantador et al.)

Procedure using results of above studies:
- conduct personality test to assess user's big five traits
- for each trait, find the movie genre for which the avg. trait value among fans of that genre (?) is closest to the user's trait value
- maybe select the genre with the least variance between the user's trait value and the avg. user trait value as the user's probably preferred genre?

is there anything else that we can do here?

Also, how quickly can we conduct a big five personality test???

if it's long, then consider a log-in feature (?)

what about films with multiple genres?







Which film genres are the most conventional???

-------------------

New approach

1. Use TIPI
2. Compare to average movie genre scores from Nalmpantis et al.

- - - - - -

You will be shown ten statements describing yourself. For each statement, please indicate how strongly you agree or disagree with the statement.

- - -

What ranges should we use?

Each trait has 2 associated questions; if the scale is 1-5 (integers) for each question, then the average score for a particular trait could have 10 different values, each one differing by 0.5. This might not be precise enough to use with the data from the Cantador et al. study

Update: after review, it turns out that the genre list used in Cantador et al. is missing about half of the genres recognized by the TMDB, and vice versa

in tmdb but not cantador et al.:
- fantasy
- history
- western
- thriller (maybe similar to neo-noir?)
- crime (maybe similar to neo-noir?)
- documentary
- mystery
- music (see TMDB website)
- family
- tv movie (might want to ignore this one anyway)

in cantador et al. but not in tmdb:
- cartoon
- cult
- foreign
- independent
- neo-noir
- parody
- tragedy
